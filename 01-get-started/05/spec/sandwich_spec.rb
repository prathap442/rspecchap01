  # we can prove that the object ids are different for the different test cases
  #Hooks are great for running common setup code that has real-world side effects. If you need to clear out a test database before each example, a hook is a great place to do so. 
  #They also work fine for stashing your test objects in instance variables, as weâ€™ve done here. However, instance variables have a few drawbacks.
